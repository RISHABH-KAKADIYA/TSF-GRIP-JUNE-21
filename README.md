1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
1. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
1. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w](http://bit.ly/w)
1. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
1. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
